Comprehensive multi-omics analysis of tandem duplicator phenotypes in non-small cell lung cancer
The Tandem Duplicator Phenotype (TDP) stands out as a significant genomic feature commonly observed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Comprehensive multi-omics datasets, encompassing DNA copy number variations, transcriptomics, somatic single-nucleotide variations, clinical records, and cell-line drug sensitivity profiles from projects like TCGA and CCLE, are meticulously examined to unveil the distinctive attributes associated with TDP.
